## Steps of Launching my First EC2 Instance
Having logged into my AWS account as a Root User, I navigated to the path Services> Compute> EC2> Launch Instance.

In the 'Launch an Instance' page, I entered the name of my EC2 Instance as EC2_Ukonta.
Next, I set my AMI to Ubuntu 64-bit Architecture
Instance type = t2.micro

For security, I created an RSA key pair (.pem file format).
I downloaded and saved the .pem certificate file of the key pair on my local drive and iCloud for future authentication.

All Network settings, storage configurations and advanced details were left at default settings.

After double-checking my configurations, I launched the EC2 instance!


Navigating to my Instances, I can see my instance running with Instance ID i-0eb68b32c95f6be5f.
